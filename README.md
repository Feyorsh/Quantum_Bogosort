# Quantum Bogosort
This was my project for QED 2021 and ~~(potentially?)~~ my submission for the Chicago STEM fair. Everything is in the [paper](paper.pdf) and you might even want to take a look at the [slides](slides.pdf), but if you have questions you can email me at [ghuebner@cps.edu](#).

Note that you ~~might~~will need to mess around with the code in [testing.ipynb](testing.ipynb), especially if you're trying to get LaTeX to behave on your machine. I used a really hacky implementation of [qasm2circ](https://www.media.mit.edu/quanta/qasm2circ/) and consequently my actual project structure looked a bit different from what you see.
